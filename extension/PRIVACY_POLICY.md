# Privacy Policy – Oppli Chrome Extension

The Oppli Chrome Extension does not send personal data to external servers.

Data from LinkedIn (such as jobs, names, roles, companies, and profile links) is stored locally:
- temporarily in the extension’s storage (queue), and
- merged into `window.localStorage` of https://oppli.io under the app key (`oppli-db-v1`).

This data never leaves your browser unless you manually back it up or export it.  
We do not sell, share, or transmit your data to third parties.
